# Automobile Maintenance Tracker
Tracking the maintenance of automobiles from a web application.

# How to use
This web application is designed to schedule the maintenance of vehicles as they need it. It is based on the odometer reading and the year that car was manufactured to suggest what maintenance should be done.

Three types of cars have been included: Electric, Gas and Diesel cars. In the web app, you can set make, model, year, license number, VIN and odometer reading of the vehicle, and the app suggests the respective maintenance. In the run time, you can update the odometer reading and the suggestion for maintenance will be updated based on the year and odometer readings.
